# Timelines
 
These are the interactive timelines I have been working on in the spirit of [public history](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-centre-public-history/about-acph/what-public-history) - to bring the academic economic history to the general public. 
I am planning to continue to expand these and foray into more such projects.

## Object-oriented timelines

### - [Tea](/tea)
In this timeline of tea, I have tried to bring together the global perspectives and economic perspectives for historical explorations of the tea.

#   

### - [Coffee](/coffee)
Timeline of Coffee tries to trace its origins back to the Middle East and Africa. The timeline tries to explore global connections and links of coffee with colonialism in this interactive timeline.
