# Philosophy: Where to Start

There are specific suggestions for further reading after each entry in this book,

but the following are good places to start if you are interested in exploring the

practical side of philosophy more generally.

Philip J. Ivanhoe and Bryan W. Van Norden (eds), Readings

in Classical Chinese Philosophy (2nd edition, Hackett, 2005)

Until recently, Western readers were drawn to classical Chinese philosophy

mainly for its promise of mystical divination (I Ching) or for business guidance

(The Art of War). Now people are waking up to the enduring interest of

Confucian, Daoist and Legalist thought. These schools pull in different

directions. Confucianism advocates a social and inner harmony that comes

from personal virtue, Daoism the need to live in harmony with the natural

order, and Legalism a somewhat cynical belief that only strong laws can hold

society together. This excellent anthology contains core writings from them all.

Deepak Sarma (ed.), Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader

(Columbia University Press, 2011)

At first blush, classical Indian philosophy can look more like theology than

philosophy. In fact, the distinction can barely be made, such is the

intermingling of the two on the subcontinent. But there is plenty of interest to

the non-religious, particularly in the materialist Charvaka school, the analysis

of argumentation in Nyaya, and the rich Buddhist tradition. This anthology

contains helpful notes and introductions, as well as a good selection of core

texts.

Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha’s Words: An Anthology of

Discourses from the Pali Canon (Wisdom Publications, 2005)

People debate whether Buddhism is a philosophy or a religion, but this is a

false choice: it is clearly both. One of the most important aspects of its

philosophy is the idea that nothing has a fixed, abiding essence and thateverything, including the self, is a temporary collection of parts. This

anthology collects some the earliest texts.

Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (various editions)

Aristotle is our philosophical hero. He was much more grounded than his

teacher Plato, who sometimes seemed more interested in a perfect world of

ultimate reality than the one we live in. None of Aristotle’s actual books

survive and the Ethics, like all his other extant writings, is a collection of

lecture notes. Aristotle is appropriately modest about how far philosophy can

go. We never tire of his adage: ‘It is the mark of an educated mind to rest

satisfied with the degree of precision which the nature of the subject admits

and not to seek exactness where only an approximation is possible.’

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (various editions)

The Stoics and the Epicureans bequeathed innumerable eminently quotable

gems that often thrive nowadays as online memes. Modern readers tend to

ignore the more demanding or counterintuitive aspects of their teachings. But

a book like Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations can be read as a source of insight

without the reader having to buy into the whole system. You don’t have to be

Stoic to see that ‘The things you think about determine the quality of your

mind. Your soul takes on the colour of your thoughts.’

David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals

(various editions)

Hume is the philosophers’ philosopher, coming top of a poll of professional

academics who were asked which dead thinker they most identified with. The

heir of Aristotle, he had even less time for abstract reasoning or obtuse

metaphysical speculation. Hume has not achieved wide popularity outside

academia, partly because the practical application of his ideas isn’t always

obvious and partly because his long, eighteenth-century sentences can be a

little difficult to tune into. Give it time though, and it becomes clear why he

was considered not only a philosophical genius but a great prose stylist.

Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms (Penguin,

1976)

Schopenhauer presents a grand system, in the manner of much modern

German philosophy. However, we would suggest that he is best read not as anengineer of a fantastical metaphysical system but as a poet, whose piecemeal

insights are much more than the sum of their parts. It is easier to do this in

his essays and aphorisms, which can be read independently for the gems they

contain. Be prepared to be disturbed: Schopenhauer looks the struggle of life

in the face with unremitting persistence.

Søren Kierkegaard, The Living Thoughts of Kierkegaard,

edited by W.H. Auden (New York Review Books, 2009)

Kierkegaard is a poet-philosopher with an acute and analytic intellect. His

vast output is impressive, given his short life – he died at the age of 42. It is

also bewildering, since he wrote from the point of view of various

pseudonymous authors, each analysing a philosophical outlook from the

inside. At the heart of his philosophy is the idea that human life contains

contradictions that cannot be reconciled by reason, and that we need to take a

leap of faith which embraces the paradox of the human condition. This

collection, edited by the poet W.H. Auden, is a good entry point.

Viktor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning (1946)

Existentialism claims that we can create our own meaning in a universe

without purpose. The writing of the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who survived

Auschwitz, provides remarkable evidence that this is possible. Frankl was the

founder of logotherapy, a modality of psychotherapy based on the idea that

our primary motivation is to find meaning in life.

Simone de Beauvoir, The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947)

For decades, Beauvoir was cast as Sartre’s disciple and lover. Belatedly, many

scholars now argue that she was not only his equal but in many ways his

superior. Sartre never managed to articulate an ethics based on his existential

philosophy. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, Beauvoir does a better job of

articulating the ethical dimension of the existentialist philosophy of freedom.

If it is too dense for your taste, Kate Kirkpatrick’s biography Becoming

Beauvoir (Bloomsbury, 2019) is eminently readable.

Bernard Williams, Moral Luck (Cambridge University Press,

1981)

Philosophers are often known for the positions they take. Bernard Williams

was different. A brilliant analyst of the puzzles and problems of human life, herefused to provide neat answers. To read him is to accompany an exceptional

intellect in his thinking. Moral Luck is a collection of essays published in

academic journals, but you would never know that from their lucidity and

elegance.

Thomas Nagel, Mortal Questions (Cambridge University

Press, 1991)

Death, war, equality, sex, personal identity – Nagel’s book deals with the big

questions of life and value with sensitivity and intellectual rigour. This

collection of essays also includes the classic ‘What Is It Like to Be a Bat?’,

which gets to the heart of why consciousness seems so mysterious. Nagel is in

no hurry to offer solutions, knowing that our first priority is to be clear about

the shape of the problem.

Martha Nussbaum, The Therapy of Desire (Princeton

University Press, 1994)

It has become commonplace to champion the Hellenistic philosophies of the

Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics as therapies for our time. Nussbaum did this

earlier and with more subtlety and insight than most contemporary

cheerleaders. She also includes the philosopher without whom these later

schools would never have existed: Aristotle. The book uses the fictional device

of a young woman working her way through the various schools. It’s

accessible, wise and engaging.

Pierre Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life (Blackwell, 1995)

Hadot championed the idea that ancient philosophy was a practical system for

flourishing, not just an attempt to describe reality. Philosophy as a Way of Life

attempts to describe the ‘spiritual practices’ that were as essential as the

theories they were based on. He finds them in philosophers from Socrates to

Michel Foucault.

Daniel Dennett, Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking

(W.W. Norton, 2013)

Philosophy is often championed as a way of learning critical thinking. There

are few better arguments for this than Dennett’s Intuition Pumps. He covers

some classic principles and methods of reasoning such as Occam’s razor (‘donot postulate more entities than are needed for an explanation’) and reductio

ad absurdum (showing that a position is absurd by taking it to its logical

conclusions). It is also packed with his own inventions, such as ‘skyhooks’

(groundless nothings on which people hang treasured beliefs) and ‘deepities’

(profound-sounding but empty pronouncements). A masterclass in how to

reason better.
